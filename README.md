# SNCF project 

This github's goal is to answer this question: How can we anticipate the crowd in public transport stations for next year?

It is organized as follow:
- Code (pre processing, ML skforecasting methode, DL LSTM method)
- Report (detail of the approach)
- Streamlit (presentation of the results)
